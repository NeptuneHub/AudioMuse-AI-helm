# GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 19 November 2007  

Copyright (C) 2025 NeptuneHub

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program become available for other developers to incorporate, as long as they too make the source code available to their users.

If you run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate with it, your server must also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the modified version. This means you must ensure the freedom of users who interact with your software over a network.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions  
Please see the full [AGPLv3 License text](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html#section0) for complete definitions of terms such as "Source Code", "Object Code", "Covered Work", and others.

### 1. Source Code  
You must make the source code of your program available under the same license when distributing or hosting it.

### 2. Basic Permissions  
All users have the right to run, study, share, and modify the program. This license ensures that all copies and modifications remain under the AGPL.

### 3. Conveying Modified Source Versions  
When you modify the source code and convey it, you must clearly state the changes and keep the license notice intact. If you run it on a server, you must provide access to the complete source code.

### 4. Remote Network Interaction  
If you modify the program and use it to interact with users remotely through a computer network, you must ensure those users can also access the source code.

### 5. No Sublicensing  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by the AGPL.

### 6. Acceptance Not Required  
You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy. However, you accept it by modifying or distributing the program.

### 7. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients  
Each time you convey the program, the recipient automatically receives a license under the AGPL.

### 8. Termination  
Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you violate it, but they can be reinstated under certain conditions.

### 9. No Warranty  
The program is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 10. Limitation of Liability  
In no event will the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability.
